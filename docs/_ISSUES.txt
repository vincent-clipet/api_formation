Lesson is broken in schema

==========================================

user/:id/setrole
	=> probably need to check (properly) that this role exists, instead of returning a foreign key violationj

role/:id/update
	=> with empty [], works, but does not return anything
	=> not tested with actual [] parameters

training/:id/delete
	=> error 500 + stacktrace when already deleted (404 instead ?)
training/:id
	=> should return its associated modules. Maybe in new route ? (training/:id/modules)

module/:id/update
	=> error 500
		TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')
    	at ModuleController.moduleUpdate (C:\Users\Apprenant\Documents\Git\pire2pire_api\src\controller\module.controller.ts:101:38)
module/:id/delete
	=> error 500
		Invalid `this.prismaService.module.delete()` invocation in
		C:\Users\Apprenant\Documents\Git\pire2pire_api\src\controller\module.controller.ts:70:48
		An operation failed because it depends on one or more records that were required but not found. Record to delete does not exist.
