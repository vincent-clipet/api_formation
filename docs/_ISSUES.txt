- Auth doesn't work
- Include sub-elements when returning Training / Module / Lesson / Role

- lessonController :
	- create : author -> authorId ?
	- update : name is not updatable

- User signup : 500 if no args given. 500 if name already exists
- User delete : doesn't work (404)

- Module update :
	- can create multiple relations with the same IDs (module & lesson) without any errors
	- deleteLessons : 500 if  not exists

- Lesson create : Lesson has both "author" AND "authorId" in its fields
	- Seeded values should probably have the author set instead of NULL



=============================================


User :
	- get : 500 if doesn't exist
	- create : creating an already existing user should return 400
