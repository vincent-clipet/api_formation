Line endings of cURL scripts are broken, won't run on Windows anymore

==========================================

user/:id/setrole
	=> probably need to check (properly) that this role exists, instead of returning a foreign key violationj

role/:id/update
	=> with empty [], works, but does not return anything
	=> not tested with actual [] parameters

formation/:id/delete
	=> error 500 + stacktrace when already deleted (404 instead ?)
formation/:id
	=> should return its associated modules. Maybe in new route ? (formation/:id/modules)
